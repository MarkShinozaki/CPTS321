## C# - Software Engineering Principles

> [!TIP]
> This first assignment is meant to introduce students to creating a repository and working within the GitLab system.


### Steps: 
1. Set up / Create a repository for Homework assignments called CptS321-HWs. 
2. In Cpts321-Hws, create an empty solution (either VS Community or Rider). 
3. In the same way you created Cpts321-HWs, create another repository called Cpts321-in-class-excerises and create a blank solution in it.
4. Make both Repos Private
5. Find the EECS GitLab username for your TA's, Venera's is (varnaoud)
6. After finding all GitLab usernames, make Venera and TAs maintainers on both Cpts321-HWs and Cpts321-in-class-excerises
7. Add a readme file if one is not there, include your full name at the top and WSU ID
8. add gitignore file
9. In both Repos, go to Code section -> Commits -> pick the most recent commit -> options -> then tag, Name the tag HW0
10. Submit both tags to canvas
