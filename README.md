### Homework 0: Overview
#### Repository Setup and Management

#### Details of the Tasks:
##### 1. Repository Creation:

- Create two separate GitLab repositories on the EECS server:
  - `CptS321-HWs`: This will be used for all homework assignments.
  - `CptS321-in-class-exercises`: This will be used for all in-class exercises.
- Create an empty (blank) solution in both repositories using Visual Studio (for Windows and WinForms) or Rider (for cross-platform development).

##### 2. Repository Configuration:

- Set both repositories to private.
- Add the instructor and all TAs as "Maintainers" to both repositories (use EECS GitLab IDs; email invites will not work).
- Add a `README` file to both repositories that includes your full name and WSU ID.
- Set up `.gitignore` in both repositories.

##### 3. Tagging and Submission:

- Tag the versions of the repositories you want to be graded with the tag `HW0`.
- Submit the links to these repositories (either the tag or branch links) via Canvas by the HW deadline.
- Additionally, submit the links to the main branches of both repositories in the survey for Week 2, by Thursday of Week 2.

## [Homework 1](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS321-SoftwareEngineeringPrinciples/tree/Homeworks/CPTS321-SoftwareEngineeringPrinciples-Homework-1)

### Homework 1: Overview
#### Binary Search Tree (BST) Number List in Console/Terminal

#### Topics Covered:
- Basic data structures (Binary Search Tree)
- Command-line input and output
- Implementation of custom algorithms

#### Details of the Tasks:
##### 1. Input Handling:

- Create a C# console application that reads a single line of integers separated by spaces. All integers will be in the range [0, 100].

##### 2. Binary Search Tree Implementation:

- Implement your own Binary Search Tree (BST) to store the integers in the order they are entered.
- Ensure that no duplicates are added to the tree.

##### 3. Sorted Output:

- Traverse the BST in order and display the numbers in sorted order (smallest to largest).

##### 4. Statistics Display:

- Display the following statistics about the BST:
  - Total number of items.
  - Number of levels in the tree.
  - Theoretical minimum number of levels based on the number of nodes.

##### 5. Repository Management and Submission:

- Work on this assignment in a branch called `Branch_HW1`.
- Before the deadline, tag the version you want to be graded with `HW1`.
- Submit the link to the repository (either the tag or branch link) via Canvas by the HW deadline.

##### 6. Points Breakdown:

- Fulfillment of requirements: 5 points.
- Quality of version control: 1 point.
- Code cleanliness and efficiency: 1 point.
- Identifier quality: 1 point.
- Comment quality: 1 point.
- Test case quality: 1 point.
