> [!NOTE]
> Below are the links to the in-person class assignments, at the end of the semester if you have completed all in-person/TDDs class assignments you will recieve credit for them, but this credit isn't worth very much. I have compiled a list of all the In-Class work you will have to complete that I could find, but there could be some I am missing. It is advised to attend all classes and periodically complete these assignments in class and then tag them. 

> [!WARNING]
> All These in-class Assignments are subject to change and may not be up-to-date, always refer to the current distributed material you are provided with.
