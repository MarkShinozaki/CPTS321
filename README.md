## Recommended textbook:

Joseph Albahari, C# 9.0 in a Nutshell: The Definitive Reference, O’Reilly Media, 2021. ISBN-13: 978-1098100964.
Essential C# Book: https://essentialcsharp.comLinks to an external site.
Grading framework: Grades will be based on the following (points are in parenthesis):

- 3 exams as follows: Mid-term 1 (25 points; in class and on paper), Mid-term 2 (25 points; in class and on paper), and Final Exam (30 points; take-home).

- Being present in class (10 points). You are expected to attend all lectures. An absence will cost you 1 point each time unless the instructor is made aware of your inability to attend class. It is the responsibility of the student to provide a written explanation for the absence to the instructor as soon as it is reasonable to do so. When possible, students should provide appropriate documentation for their absence. Students who attempt to gain advantage through abuse of this policy (e.g., by providing an instructor with false information) will be referred to the Center for Community Standards for disciplinary action.

- 11 homework assignments (10 points each). See more details on assignments below.

Note that this course is heavily focused on an ongoing project, which each piece building upon the prior work on a week by week basis. If you get 100% on the exams and fail to complete the coding assignments, you will fail the course.

***

## Bonus points:

- Participation (up to 20 points): You can accumulate bonus points for participation in class. This means 1) working on the in-class exercises and submitting your code to the EECS GitLab repo (you must create a separate repo for in-class exercises – do not use the repo for the HW assignments; for your coding exercise to be considered for bonus points, you must tag it by the end of class) and 2) being interactive, i.e., ask and answer questions in class or on Canvas.

- In class presentation (10 points): Presentations will be scheduled in the beginning of the semester following a FIFO basis – to reserve a spot you must send an email to the instructor with your name, WSU ID, and the names, emails, and WSU IDs of the team members if known (cc all team members). Please send a few topics and dates and order them by preference. Topics and presentation dates are available in the syllabus (see highlighted slots in the above table). Presentation will last for the duration of a class (i.e., 50 min). Each presentation must include two components: presentation on the topic and a coding demo, each of those would take roughly half of the time. You must discuss the outline or the presentation with the instructor before you start preparing. Presentations will be made in groups of 2 or 3, unless stated otherwise by the instructor. Note: You are responsible to attend and know topics covered by students for the exams and assignments. Deliverables:
          1) Deliverable 1: A first draft of the presentation slides and coding demo must be submitted to the instructor on Week 6 Week 8.
          2) Deliverable 2: The final presentation addressing the feedback from the instructor is due on Week 11. 

- Opportunity for additional bonus work will be announced later in the semester.

***

## Grades 

Your final percentage is obtained as follows: (# of points on exams and homeworks  + # of bonus points) * 100% / 200. 

Final grades will be awarded on the following scale:

Interval           Grade

- >= 95%               A
- >=90% and <95%       A‐
- >=87% and <90%       B+
- >=83% and <87%       B
- >=80% and <83%       B‐
- >=77% and <80%       C+
- >=73% and <77%       C
- >=70% and <73%       C‐
- >=65% and <70%       D+
- >=60% and <65%       D
- < 60%                F

## Exams

You must take exam during the assigned test period. Failure to do so will result in a score of zero. However, in extraordinary circumstances and at the discretion of the instructor, a make‐up exam may be offered. An advanced notice must be given to the instructor beforehand.

Assignments and in-class exercises

In this course you will be keeping all of your source code in the EECS GitLab server (https://gitlab.eecs.wsu.eduLinks to an external site.). Assignments and in-class exercises will be submitted via Git and via Canvas; check assignment instructions and turn in guide for details. Code must be committed regularly through Git and not by using the user interface of GitLab. No code committed as a zip file or sent by email will be accepted. Version control and collaboration tools are used in any industry position worth having. The course will have an organization set up on the VCEA GitLab server and you will create your own repositories to work in there. The TAs and instructor will clone your repos to get your project’s source. Make sure you’re not checking in precompiled binaries to your Git repo. It’s an easy thing to do accidentally, but they shouldn’t be in there.

Homeworks and in-class exercises are considered SUBMITTED if they are “TAGGED” AND they are submitted via Canvas (check instructions for details) – this is valid for late submissions as well. Only assignments that are ‘tagged’ on GitLab and submitted via Canvas before the deadline will be graded by TAs (check instructions for details). Late homework will be allowed only in exceptional cases. Note that other exams or assignments are not an exceptional case. To request an approval for a late submission in an exceptional case, an email must be sent to the instructor and ALL TAs, and that must be BEFORE the deadline when possible. If the instructor has not approved an extension, late assignments are given a zero. Approved late submissions must be tagged on GitLab, submitted on Canvas, and a follow-up email must be sent to all TAs and the instructor in order to be considered for grading.

***

## When turning in your work:

Put your name and ID number in comments at the top of your code files as well as in a readme file in your repository.
If your code doesn’t compile when you submit, it’s a zero.
Make sure to check with a clean clone of your code before committing and tagging the version you want the TA to compile and run.
Assignments build on top of each other in this class. Do not hack things together or else it will cost you later on. You are not entitled to a solution to any homework assignment because you did poorly on it. If a later homework assignment requires you to fix things from a prior assignment, then you must do that.
If time/space complexity requirements are not specifically stated in a problem, then any “reasonable” time/space complexity will be accepted. Note that software that takes > 5 seconds for just about anything we do in this course is probably NOT reasonable. You can’t have a time complexity so bad that it takes an unreasonable amount of time to compute things. You also can’t do things like allocate 4GB of memory to perform an operation. If it wouldn’t be reasonable for simple industry software, then it is not reasonable in this course.
The design must show effective use of object-oriented programming concepts. If you write a bunch of code that just looks/feels like C code and does not utilize C# language features well, then you will be penalized for this.
“It worked when I tested it”. Great, but if it doesn’t work when the TA(s) test it, then you can certainly get a poor grade on the assignment. Look in the comments associated with your assignment grades online and the TA will explain what you missed points on. If you are uncertain as to why things went wrong when they ran your code, talk to them during office hours.
Read the instructions carefully. Not understanding the instructions means you’re probably going to lose points and you won’t be given those points back just by claiming “I misread it”. If there are ambiguities about an assignment, ask me for clarification before you start the solution implementation.
You are expected to need to use certain outside sources to help learn the necessary material for many assignments. Cite sources in a document.

***

## Monitor your progress:
Check your grades on a regular basis (three times weekly should suffice) and deal with issues as soon as they arise.
Deal with grading issues no more than 4 days after the grade has been posted. If you choose to follow up late on a grading issue, then you will have missed your chance. Grades will become solidified within 4 days of being entered and will not be changed after this point.
The TA(s) should be the first one you contact when you have a question about your homework grades (email ALL TAs and cc the instructor).
Assignments will be graded within 8 days of their due dates, so should this time pass and you do not have a grade for an assignment that you submitted, then please contact me and the TA(s).
You have the grading scale listed in this document and your grades are viewable online as soon as they’ve been entered. There shouldn’t be any surprises by the end of the semester about your grade. Monitor your progress and change the way you work in the course if you’re not maintaining a passing grade.
 
This course will be moving quickly on the projects and keeping up is invaluable to your success. If you are having a difficult term for reasons outside of your control, please contact the WSU Access Center (https://accesscenter.wsu.edu/Links to an external site.) to ensure you get the help you need during the term.

***

## Presence:
Attendance in class is mandatory and accounts for 10 points of your final grade.

***

## Communication:

When emailing, please have “CptS321” in the email subject, followed by additional words describing the inquiry. For example, if you are emailing to get clarification on homework instructions, the title should be something like “CptS321 – Clarification on HW5 instructions”. This will help us both understand the timeliness of the email and to be able to find it later if there’s further conversation about it.

Do not send emails that you wouldn’t send to an employer. If it’s not professional in the business world, then it’s not acceptable in the academic world either. That’s the way this class is going to be run. It’s not normally an issue, but before you hit send make sure to re-read your message to ensure it’s clear and professionally written.

## Academic Integrity:

Washington State University, a community dedicated to the advancement of knowledge, expects all students to behave in a manner consistent with its high standards of scholarship and conduct. Students are expected to uphold these standards both on and off campus and acknowledge the university's authority to take disciplinary action. The purpose of these standards and processes is to educate students and protect the welfare of the community.

University instructors have the authority to intervene in all situations where students are suspected of academic dishonesty. In such instances, responsible instructors retain the authority to assign grades to students considering, from an academic standpoint, the nature of the student action. The consequences for such actions should be spelled out beforehand in the syllabus. More information regarding responding to academic integrity violations can be found at: https://communitystandards.wsu.edu/Links to an external site..

Feel free to contact the Center for Community Standards if you would like more specific information about the process. Contact information for each campus can be found at: https://communitystandards.wsu.edu/contacts-by-campus/Links to an external site..

The Writing Program (509-335-7959) can assist with proactive assignment design that minimizes the risk of academic dishonesty.

## Notes on Cheating:
The digital nature of computer science can make cheating a very tempting option.  Remember that cheating can result in a failing grade for the whole course. In order to make sure that this doesn’t happen, I've included some potential scenarios to help guide your behavior. 

You and some friends are working together on the next homework and you just finished the assignment.  Unfortunately, you have to head off to work.  A friend who isn't finished asks to get a copy of the assignment from you so that he can use it as a guide.  Wanting to be a good friend, you email him a copy of your assignment on the guarantee that he won't copy.  This is cheating.  You are not allowed to give copies (analog or digital) of your work.  More often than not, your friend will copy and paste some of your work into his assignment.  This will likely show up when I run my cheat detection software.  This is a very common way to get in trouble.  Don’t do it!
During an exam or other testing environment, you use your phone to ask someone else a question.  Alternatively, you receive an email or text message from someone in class asking for help and you respond.  Both cases are considered to be cheating. Communicating in any manner during a testing environment is not allowed.
As part of a lab, you're required to implement a poker game.  A quick Google search reveals several existing implementations.  You download the project and modify it to suit the requirements of the lab.  This is cheating.
You and a friend are working together on an assignment using the same computer.  As a result, both of you turn in the same or nearly identical assignments.  As I cannot determine who actually did the work, I must consider this to be cheating.  Remember, you must turn in original work typed out entirely by yourself.
You and some friends are getting together after class to discuss the assignment due tomorrow.  You're done and want to help your friends out.  To do so, you discuss the assignment using high-level descriptions (e.g., "I have class X that does Y, which helps me get task Z done") and even draw some nice pictures and/or flowcharts for them to follow.  This is NOT cheating and is actually encouraged.
Your friend is almost done with his homework assignment but has run into a nasty debugging issue.  You take a look at his program and quickly realize that he isn't correctly deleting a dynamically created pointer.  You show him how to fix his error.  This is NOT cheating and is actually encouraged!
A student has asked for code help on the course's online discussion forum.  You respond with a partial code snippet.  This is NOT cheating and is actually encouraged!
If you find yourself in a situation that is not listed above and are worried about whether or not it might be considered cheating, error on the side of caution and don't do it.  Instead, email me (I usually respond fairly quickly).  I'll give you a definitive answer and add it to the list above.

> [!TIP]
> Always Commit code progressively.
> Write tests for each method/function.
> Never ever just copy code from the internet and paste it into your Document.
> If you use AI tools make sure to always Clean, Build and check for logic errors.

## Policy Prohibiting Discrimination and Harassment (Executive Policy 15):

This policy expresses WSU’s commitment to maintaining an environment free from discrimination, including sexual harassment. This policy applies to all students, faculty, staff, or others having an association with the University.

Discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, sexual harassment, and sexual misconduct (including stalking, intimate partner violence, and sexual violence) is prohibited at WSU (See WSU Policy Prohibiting Discrimination and Harassment (Executive Policy 15) and WSU Standards of Conduct for Students).

If you feel you have experienced or have witnessed discriminatory conduct, you can contact the WSU Office of Civil Rights Compliance & Investigation (CRCI) and/or the WSU Title IX Coordinator at 509-335-8288 to discuss resources, including confidential resources, and reporting options. (Visit crci.wsu.edu for more information).

Most WSU employees, including faculty, who have information regarding sexual harassment or sexual misconduct are required to report the information to CRCI or a designated Title IX Coordinator or Liaison. Visit https://crci.wsu.edu/reporting- requirements/ for more information.

***

## Accommodation for Religious Observances or Activities:

Washington State University reasonably accommodates absences allowing for students to take holidays for reasons of faith or conscience or organized activities conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization. Reasonable accommodation requires the student to coordinate with the instructor on scheduling examinations or other activities necessary for course completion. Students requesting accommodation must provide written notification within the first two weeks of the beginning of the course and include specific dates for absences. Approved accommodations for absences will not adversely impact student grades. Absence from classes or examinations for religious reasons does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence. Students who feel they have been treated unfairly in terms of this accommodation may refer to Academic Regulation 104 – Academic Complaint Procedures.

*** 

## Safety:

Classroom and campus safety are of paramount importance at Washington State University, and are the shared responsibility of the entire campus population. WSU urges students to follow the “Alert, Assess, Act,” protocol for all types of emergencies and the “Run, Hide, FightLinks to an external site.” response for an active shooter incident. Remain ALERT (through direct observation or emergency notification), ASSESS your specific situation, and ACT in the most appropriate way to assure your own safety (and the safety of others if you are able). Please sign up for emergency alerts on your account at MyWSULinks to an external site.. For more information on this subject, campus safety, and related topics, please view the FBI’s Run, Hide, Fight videoLinks to an external site. and visit the classroom safety page provost.wsu.edu/classroom-safetyLinks to an external site..
